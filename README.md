About.html - Contains html code fro about me page. This is a very simple page containing a picture of me with a brief description.

gaming.html - Contains html code for gaming page. This page is simply a table containing the games that i play ranked from the game that i play the most down to the one that i play the least.

resume.html - Contains html code for resume page. This page is a rough copy of my resume that i plan to beef up in the future.

Styles.css - This file contains the css code that most of the site relies on. I could have just done it all through index.scss but i started the sass code later in the project.
